The Gari Resort is a delightful abode for a perfect weekend getaway for teams to rejuvenate, revive, and have a fresh start of the week or month. They have numerous activities to keep you hooked through out the day during your visit.  The thing about night skies away from the city is that they are less polluted and you donâ€™t really need an elevation of a mountain to take a closer look at the galaxy. The camping experience is somewhat same as being on a mountain and something to try with your colleagues as The Gari is among one of the most visited budget resorts in Bangalore.
